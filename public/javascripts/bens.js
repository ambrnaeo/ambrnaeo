Scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg in Germany have been trying to find out which genes are involved in the cellular process known as Mitosis &#8211; when a cell divides, and to do that they&#39;ve made a stunning 190,000 time-lapse videos of cells.</p> <p>GLONASS<br> Everything from cars to cell phones now seems to offer it &#8211; GPS or satellite navigation. GPS stands for Global Positioning System, and the satellites it uses are owned by the US.  But rivals to GPS are coming.  With Europe&#39;s project Galileo underway and China starting to develop their own.  The Russians has been trying to speed up their pace in the sat nav race as well.  In early March, another three Russian satellites of the GLONASS global navigation system were launched into orbit, bringing the constellation to 21.  This ensures total coverage of Russia as well as partial global coverage.  While the system has been working relatively well for military use, the commercial side hasn&#39;t been going as smoothly. But the Russians say it&#39;s all about to change.</p> <p>Katia Moskvitch went to Moscow for Science in Action to find out what&#39;s going on.</p> <p>CubeSail<br> A new device is set to play a major part in cleaning up the dangerous clouds of metal debris hurtling around the Earth&#39;s lower orbit.</p> <p>More than 5,500 tonnes of &#39;space junk&#39; are now believed to be cluttering space around the planet as a result of years of abandoning spacecraft, satellites and launch material.  The potential threat of large debris plummeting back to Earth, and obstructions to satellite TV signals is becoming a problem.  The amount of debris is increasing by 5% each year.</p> <p>The Surrey Space Centre has unveiled its solution to the problem - CubeSail, a solar powered sail which can be attached both to new satellites and to existing debris, dragging the debris and defunct spacecraft out of orbit.  It&#39;s a low cost technology, the first CubeSail is to be ready for launch on new satellites next year, and is expected to be available for shifting existing debris from 2013.</p> <p>Young Sun Paradox<br> This week a long-standing scientific paradox may have been answered in the journal Nature.  The young sun paradox, first identified by the famous American astronomer Carl Sagan in the 1970&#39;s.</p> <p>To put it simply, if the sun used to be much less intense, why wasn&#39;t the Earth much colder and the oceans frozen solid?  Answering that could help us understand the intricacies of our atmosphere and global climate.  Well in a paper published in the journal Nature this week Professor Minik Rosing geologist at the Natural History Museum of Denmark thinks he&#39;s finally struck on the answer and it&#39;s not the expected greenhouse effect.</p> <p>Earthquake toads<br> European or Common toads (Bufo bufo) can detect impending seismic activity and alter their behaviour from breeding to evacuation mode, suggests a new study in the Zoological Society of London&#39;s (ZSL) Journal of Zoology.</p> <p>Dr. Rachel Grant from The Open University in the UK experienced the earthquake that struck L&#39;Aquila in Italy in 2009 and reported that 96 per cent of male toads in a population abandoned their breeding site five days before the earthquake.  The breeding site was located 74 km from the earthquake&#39;s epicentre.</p>          </div>';

Many species of birds have suffered and there has been concern over deer which have moved to lower ground in search of food and, in some places, have literally been starving to death . The long term effect could be devastating and recovery could take years. Farmers have struggled to reach livestock and those that have managed to do so find themselves facing huge bills for extra feed. And in forests many trees have either died or lost branches when succumbing to the heavy weight of snow on their boughs.</p> <p>But is it all bad news? Reports of a midge free summer after the icy weather caused the hibernating insects to freeze to death in the ground have been greeted with delight by tourists and locals alike. And in ancient forests such as the Abernethy Nature Reserve which works to create deadwood, this winter has been one of their best with naturally created deadwood serving as food for bugs which, in turn provide a hearty meal for birds. So, has it been an exceptionally bad winter......or have we simply forgotten what a &#39;real&#39; winter is like?</p> <p>Helen journeys through the Highlands of Scotland to find out about the impact of the freezing temperatures and deep snow, which lay on the ground for almost 3 months. She begins at the Aigas Field Centre in Beauly, home of writer, Sir John Lister Kaye. For years, John has closely observed the changes in nature from his regular walks round a loch near his home and feels that this winter has hit the wildlife in the area pretty hard. From Beauly, Helen travels to the Black Isle to meet up with Dan Tomes of the RSPB to hear how the bird population has coped with the arctic conditions, particularly the barn owl which relies so heavily on the mice and voles which would have been buried under thick snow.</p> <p>But not all is doom and gloom. Wardens at the Abernethy Nature Reserve in the Cairngorm National Park, part of which is ancient Caledonian woodland, work to create deadwood which provides food for bugs and, in turn, the birds that feed on them. Helen is shown how this is done, and lends a hand by helping to winch a tree to the ground. This winter, with heavy snow on the boughs of ancient trees, the forest came to life with the gunfire sound of branches breaking and snapping naturally. For Desmond Dugan and Ian Perks at Abernethy, this has been a great winter!</p> <p>But not so for farmers. Finally, Helen travels the few miles to Balliefurth Farm where she meets farmer Alastair McLennan. Alastair has struggled through the thick snow to reach his sheep which have been reliant on supplementary feed all winter and this problem will continue well into the year with the arrival so late of spring.</p> <p>Producer: Helen Chetwynd.</p>          </div>';

Next year marks the 200th anniversary of the publication of Sense and Sensibility - the first of an incredible collection of novels that have secured Jane Austen&#39;s place as one of the most prominent writers in the history of English literature. She died at the tragically young age of 41 in Winchester in 1817 and is buried in the cathedral there. Now, a permanent exhibition next to her grave will tell her life story and display Austen memorabilia that has rarely been seen until now. Charlotte Barnaville [Winchester Cathedral&#39;s Marketing Officer] , Elizabeth Proudman [Vice Chair of the Jane Austen Society], and Rebecca Vaughan (whose one-woman show Austen&#39;s Women opens at the Leicester Square Theatre London on 20th April) join Jane Garvey to discuss the life of one of Britain&#39;s best loved authors.</p> <p>As students in their final year begin to prepare for their exams and the search for jobs, Woman&#39;s Hour looks at the role of Internships. Once an informal way of gaining work experience they are now seen as an essential rung on the ladder to employment. The experience can be mixed since many organisations only offer unpaid Internships leaving the Intern to juggle part-time jobs to pay living expenses and travel. Unequal access is also an issue where those with friends or family connections or parents wealthy enough to support them are at an advantage. Jane Garvey hears the experience of a student who did two unpaid Internships, and speaks to Gus Baker from InternAware, Heather Collier Director of the National Council for Work Experience and Anne Minto OBE, HR Director of Centrica who works closely with the CBI&#39;s Education Task Force to plug gaps between higher education and work</p> <p>Younee is a classically trained pianist from Seoul, South Korea, whose eclectic style encompasses jazz, rock and pop. She began playing the piano at the age of three in her kindergarten, and initially found composing songs a welcome relief from the strict regime of study imposed by her parents. She spent the next 20 years perfecting her classical performance in music academies, but the desire to experiment led her to explore classical improvisation, and pop and jazz songwriting. Her debut Western album, &#39;True to You&#39;, was created via Skype with the legendary London-based producer/composer Richard Niles. Younee joins Jane for a live classical performance - with a twist.</p> <p>And in a follow up to the Woman&#39;s Hour Bank Holiday special on Home and what it means to you we hear some of your views.</p>          </div>';

The region is prone to earthquakes.  In 2008, a huge quake struck in neighbouring Sichuan province.  But did the first earthquake lead to or cause this second massive quake?  Tom Parsons, a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey in California, published calculations in 2008 looking at the potential for another earthquake because of how the stresses underground had changed.  He hoped they could predict where the next big quake would occur, but did they?</p> <p>NASA&#39;S GLOBAL HAWK COMPLETES FIRST SCIENCE FLIGHT<br> NASA has successfully completed the first science flight of the Global Hawk unpiloted aircraft system over the Pacific Ocean.<br> The flight was the first of five scheduled for this month&#39;s Global Hawk Pacific, or GloPac, mission to study atmospheric science over the Pacific and Arctic oceans.</p> <p>NASA FUNDING FOR MANNED SPACE MISSION TO MOON<br> Back in February President Barack Obama announced the cancellation of the NASA project designed to take humans back to the Moon.  There was huge uproar over the announcement to shelve the &#39;Constellation&#39; programme, which was to develop new rockets to replace the Shuttle for servicing the International Space Station and hopefully to put astronauts on the lunar surface by 2020.  This week he&#39;s announced the project will still go ahead, but will be scaled down.</p> <p>VOLCANOES ON VENUS<br> Venus is an extreme place - hot and dry with a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. Because the surface is hidden by sulphuric acid clouds and the planet is similar to the Earth in size, there was early speculation that Venus might be a lush world full of life &#8211; of some sort.  Now, we believe that the Sun&#39;s heat boiled away early oceans on the planet, triggering a planet-warming runaway greenhouse effect that turned Venus into a Hellish place.  But there aren&#39;t enough impact craters on Venus to suggest that it&#39;s entirely geologically dead.  Something is smoothing out the surface.  Evidence from Europe&#39;s Venus Express probe suggests that our neighbour may still be volcanically active.</p> <p>SOUND TOURISM<br> Browse through any travel guide and they&#39;re full of wonderful pictures and descriptions of places to go and see.  But what about places to go and hear?  Professor Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer, from Salford University in the UK, thinks that we should be feasting our ears as much as our eyes on our travels around the world.  He&#39;s set up a website &quot;Sound Tourism&quot;, where he&#39;s building a sonic wonder map of the world - and he&#39;s after our help to populate it with suggestions and recordings of the most amazing aural experiences.</p> <p>KOALAS IN PERIL<br> 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and we&#39;ve been exploring the wealth of plants and animals on our planet as well as the threats and issues affecting them. Now we&#39;re turning to a very enigmatic animal from Australia - the koala - a marsupial - pouched mammal.  They spend their days chewing eucalyptus or gum trees and are an iconic Australian species.  But they are having a tough time in many areas.  Cars, dogs, and isolation because of urban development, all play their part in the animals&#39; demise.  The ABC&#39;s reporter Kim Kleidon joined Deborah Tabart who heads up the Australian Koala Foundation at the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary on the outskirts of Brisbane.</p>          </div>';
